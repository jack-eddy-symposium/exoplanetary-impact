**Main Agenda:**

1. We went around the table and introduced our research interests, personal objectives for this symposium;

2. Brain-storming ideas for the working group topics.

**Summary:**

We generated 8 potential topics to work with:

1. **Create new open source tools to create solar/stellar spectral irradiance files for use in planetary modeling.** Access online irradiance catalogs and create netcdf files on user defined spectral grid. Different one-dimensional and three-dimensional atmospheric models have different spectral grids. We want to create an easy to use python script to download stellar spectra from various sources and scale the total stellar irradiance to match the irradiance that known exoplanets would receive. Also conserve flux in each wavelength and map it onto different grids. Then 1D and 3D modellers (and potentially other researchers) can use these stellar input for modelling - and it will make it easier to do intercomparions because you are using the same spectra. 

2. **Create open source pipeline to take atmospheric output from various models and use it for PandExo/NASA PSG/Other spectroscopic suites.**

3. **Create stellar observational database for validating/constraining stellar models.** When adapting solar models to stellar studies, one major difficulty is the limited stellar observations without spatial resolution, which provides less constraint on the stellar wind and CME models. It is important to have a open access database to sumerize useful stellar observations (e.g., magnetic field, UV/X-ray emissions etc.)

4. **The role of EUV radiation in driving atmospheric escape**: "Knowledge of EUV radiation from stars in general is currently guesswork and uncertain by factors of 10 or more. We do not know whether atmospheres survive on other planets." - NExtUP website. **What tools do we need to evaluate this uncertainty?**

5. **Create wishlist of stellar or exoplanet observations for exoplanet models.**

6. **Using known stable radio source to probe the atmosphere of planet (Stellar occultation).**

7. **Create an extensive publicly available library of simulations covering fine varitions of models parameters for exoplanets particularly super earths and sub neptunes.**

8. **Work together on a draft JWST observation proposal.**
