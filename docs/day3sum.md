**Main Agenda:**

1. Making progress on the two projects.

2. A tutorial about how to write a JWST observing propsoal by Allison. 

**Summary:**

1. **Create new open source tools to generate solar/stellar spectral irradiance files AND stellar wind profiles constrained by the stellar irradiance data (e.g., wind speed, density) for use in planetary/exoplanetary.** Access online irradiance catalogs and create netcdf files on user defined spectral grid. Different one-dimensional and three-dimensional atmospheric models have different spectral grids. We want to create an easy to use python script to download stellar spectra from various sources and scale the total stellar irradiance to match the irradiance that known exoplanets would receive. Also conserve flux in each wavelength and map it onto different grids. Then 1D and 3D modellers (and potentially other researchers) can use these stellar input for modelling - and it will make it easier to do intercomparions because you are using the same spectra. 

2. **Work together on a draft JWST observation proposal.** Most heliophysicists are not familiar with how to write an observising proposal (especially how to generate the observing target and specifications). We have an expert (Allison Youngblood) in the group to educate us. In addition, we want to explore new ideas (e.g., if we could get some evidences from JWST measurement about Stellar Energetic Particle influence on the exoplanet atmosphere, or if we could observe exoplanet magnetic field).
