# How to write a JWST proposal

The JWST Cycle 2 proposal deadline: January 2023.

Check out this guide for getting started with JWST proposals: https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/getting-started-with-jwst-proposing. (read in detail! you will be at a significant disadvantage if you don't read all of the information they provide)

Proposal types:
* GO (Guest Observer)
* AR (Archival Research)
* Theory
* Calibration

It's also a good idea to look over the DD-ERS (Director's Discretionary Early Release Science), GTO (Guaranteed Time Observations), and Cycle 1 GO (Guest Observer) accepted programs. Look for what planets they're observing with what modes. Use this website: https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs. Each program's APT (Astronomer's Proposal Tool) files and compiled PDFs are available; these documents contain all the same information that you will have to provide for your JWST proposal, so they're a fantastic way to learn how to setup a proposal in APT. 

If you do not already have a MyST account, get one now! https://proper.stsci.edu/proper/authentication/auth Your Co-I's will all need accounts as well.

# Proposal text

The proposal text must be uploaded to APT as a PDF. STScI provides proposal templates (Latex or Word) that you must use (https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-1/jwst-cycle-1-proposal-preparation). Make note of the page limits and read the instructions carefully. 

The proposal structure should follow:
* Science Justification
* Technical Justification
* Analysis Plan (note, not required for GO proposals)

For example, for a small proposal, the science justification section must not exceed 4 pages, but the total PDF can be 8 pages. References *do not* count against the page limit (so stick those at the very end of the PDF document). Check out this page to figure out if your proposal is small, medium, or large, which is important to know because it dictates your page limit and should inform your proposal strategy: https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-call-for-proposals-for-cycle-1/jwst-cycle-1-proposal-categories/general-observer-go-proposals/small-medium-and-large-go-proposal-categories.

The proposal process is dual anonymous, meaning that you cannot have any self-identifying information in the proposal text. Instead of saying "In Scientist et al. (2020), we found that exoplanets...", say "Scientist et al. (2020) found that exoplanets...". There is a Team Expertise section in APT that you are required to fill out where you list the expertise of the PI and Co-I's. This text is only read by the panel for the top-ranked proposals expected to be granted observing time. 

# APT

Note, STScI is paid by NASA to help YOU! Email help@stsci.edu if you are truly lost.

Sections to fill out in APT (download the app here: https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/software/astronomers-proposal-tool-apt). Note: they push updates often and will prompt you to update the app about once a month or so.
* Proposal Information (title, abstract, # hours requested, upload PDF attachment, PI, Co-I, Team Expertise text)
* Targets (probably want "Fixed Target Resolver" or "New Fixed Target")
* Observations (see https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-apt-observation-templates)
* Observation Links
